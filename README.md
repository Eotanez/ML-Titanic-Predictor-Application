# Machine Learning with the Titanic
In this project we use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. We also created a web application where you can input your own information, to see if you would survive as well.

# Titanic Survival
Titanic Survival is a web application built on python/flask with an S3 database that lets a user find out if they would have survived the Titanic sinking based on information they input. This app is hosted on heroku where you can see it [here](https://www.google.com).
